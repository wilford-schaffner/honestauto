# Honest Auto

![Honest Auto application preview](public/images/preview.png)

## Project Description

A full-stack, server-side rendered web application for a used car dealership. Visitors can browse vehicle inventory by category, view individual vehicle detail pages, and submit contact inquiries. Registered users can leave reviews on vehicles and submit service requests for their vehicles. Employees and owners have access to management dashboards for handling inventory, reviews, service requests, and contact submissions.

## Tech Stack

- Node.js with Express.js
- EJS for server-side rendering
- PostgreSQL for the database
- Session-based authentication with express-session
- Deployed on Render

## Database Schema

Entity-relationship diagram for the PostgreSQL schema (users, vehicles, categories, reviews, service requests, and related tables).

## User Roles

**Owner**  
The owner has full administrative control over the system. This includes adding, editing, and deleting vehicle categories and inventory, adding/editing vehicle images, managing employee accounts, viewing all user data, and performing every action available to employees.

**Employee**
Employees can edit vehicle details such as price, description, and availability. They can also moderate and delete inappropriate reviews, view and manage all service requests, update service request statuses (Submitted, In Progress, Completed), add notes to service requests, and view contact form submissions.

**Standard User**
Registered users can leave reviews on vehicles and edit or delete their own reviews. They can also submit service requests for their vehicles and view the status and history of their submitted requests.

## Test Account Credentials


| Role     | Email                                                     |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Owner    | [owner@dealership.com](mailto:owner@dealership.com)       |
| Employee | [employee@dealership.com](mailto:employee@dealership.com) |
| User     | [user@dealership.com](mailto:user@dealership.com)         |


## Known Limitations
- Service request updates currently rely on manual status changes by employees/owners and do not include automatic notifications to users.
- If a vehicle is created in the production environment, images uploaded are stored on Render’s ephemeral disk and may be lost on redeploy; only images shipped with the repo (e.g. under public/images/) are guaranteed to persist. (fixing this exceeds the scope of the project as described in the class).

## Repository Structure

Application code lives under `src/`. Static assets (CSS, images) are in `public/` at the repository root and are served from the site root (for example `/css/style.css`). `node_modules/`, `.env`, and `package-lock.json` are gitignored and are created or supplied when you run `npm install` and configure your environment.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Add a `.env` file with your database credentials, session secret, and any other required variables
4. Run `npm run dev` for local development (nodemon reloads on changes), or `npm start` to run the app with Node directly
